CS291A - Mixed and Augmented Reality - Term Project, Unity Application for VR Part<br/>

The ability to perceive the shape and motion of hands can be a vital component in improving the user experience across a variety of technological domains and platforms. In our project we explore utilization of hand gestures, and create an innovative interaction system based on mid-air sketching and build a VR project to best utilize said system. The project is focused on creating an immersive experience for a user placed in a Unity-based virtual world and can cast spells from their magic wand in order to summon creatures and monsters.
